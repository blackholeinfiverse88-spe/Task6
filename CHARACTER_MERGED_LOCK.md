**1. Existing Library (The Core Set)**
The fundamental units that form the backbone of the "Mythic Bharat" card system.

**Frontline & Warriors**
**Rakshas Warrior:** Standard melee unit with high durability.

**Rakshas Captain:** Leads the charge, providing small attack buffs to nearby Rakshas units.

**Vayu Putra:** High-mobility warrior inspired by legendary strength.

**Yuvraj:** Royal commander with balanced stats.

**Mahanidra:** A massive, slow-moving heavy tank.

**Kavacha Bhedi**: Specialized "Armor Breaker" that pierces high-defense targets.

**Ratna Shapta:** Cursed warrior with high risk-reward damage.

**Ranged & Elemental (Atma/Bana)**
**Suryavesha:** Solar archer with high precision and fire-based damage.

**Agni Atma:** Fire spirit dealing area-of-effect (AOE) burn damage.

**Agni Bana:** Projectile-based fire attack; high burst damage.

**Hima Atma:** Frost spirit that slows enemy attack speed.

**Vayu Rodha:** Wind-based control unit that pushes back enemies.

**Strategic & Utility Units**
**Dhyan Yogi:** High-tier support that generates Elixir or reduces cooldowns.

**Dash Mukha:** Late-game powerhouse with multi-target capabilities.

**Dyuta Vakta:** Strategist that manipulates card draw or deck order.

**Aranyarakshi:** Forest protector with high evasion in jungle terrain.

**Satyawati / Ratha Marga:** Strategic units focused on movement and positioning.

**Rakshas Patra / Mayendra:** Utility units for scouting or sacrificial tactics.

**2. System Constraints & Synergy Flags**
**Overlap Warning**: Ensure Vana Rakshak and Mahanidra have distinct "Tank" mechanics (e.g., one focuses on CC/Roots while the other focuses on raw HP).

**Role Saturation**: Currently, the set is very "Tank" heavy. Consider buffing Garuda or Suryavesha to ensure the "Sniper" and "Rusher" roles can break through the frontline.

**Synergy**: Yaksha Guardian's Mantra works exceptionally well with Kshatriya Prince's Dharma aura to create an unbreakable defensive core.
