FPS TEST NOTE 1 — Normal Match (Baseline)

Mode: Normal Match

Scenario: Standard 1v1 deployment with mixed melee + ranged units

Observation: FPS stayed stable throughout normal combat loop.

Performance Behavior: No stutter while units were attacking, pathfinding, or using abilities.

Conclusion: Baseline gameplay performance is stable and safe for demo.


FPS TEST NOTE 2 — Overtime Stress (High Load)

Mode: Overtime

Scenario: Increased unit density + continuous combat + more frequent attacks

Observation: FPS remained within acceptable range, only minor dips during heavy simultaneous attack animations.

Performance Behavior: No frame freezing, no noticeable lag spikes.

Conclusion: Overtime load does not break FPS stability; system handles combat pressure smoothly.


FPS TEST NOTE 3 — Restart Cycle (Memory + Cleanup Test)

Mode: Restart Cycle

Scenario: Restarted match multiple times with repeated spawn/death loops

Observation: FPS remained consistent across restarts, no progressive FPS drop.

Performance Behavior: No signs of memory leak, object duplication, or leftover units affecting performance.

Conclusion: Restart cleanup is stable; demo-safe with no FPS degradation over multiple cycles.
